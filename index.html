<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>
Why create this page?  I was interested in learning the
<a href="http://golang.org">Go Programming Language</a> but didn't really
have a project in mind when I set out to learn the language.  I learn best if
I use the language so I thought this might be a good approach.  I could pick
up the language while writing little code recipies for some common programming
tasks.  I figured I'd publish the page on the off chance that that someone else
might find it useful and I could refer to it again in the future.
</p>

<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>
The overall idea of this material comes from several O'Reilly <u>Cookbook</u>
style of books. Those books assume the reader already has some basic knowledge
and experience with the the language and the primary purpose of the book is to
provide a functional reference companion.
</p>

<p>
I'd also like to give advanced thanks to the authors of the Go website and
community for the overall open (free) reference material.  A few of the code
fragments below are either directly copied or heavily influence my fragments
below.  Recall that the main motiviation of this site is for <b>me</b> to
learn Go, so repeating a few examples is another way for me to improve my
understanding.
</p>

<p>
And finally, I'd like to acknowledge and thank the authors of the Go website
for making their javascript and CSS available with an open license so that
I could borrow a similar look and feel.
</p>

<h3 id="references">References</h3>
<p>
If you've somehow stumbled across this site early on in your Go adventure,
please refer to the following starter links to familiarize yourself with Go.
This site is intended to provide working code fragments for common programming
tasks.
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://golang.org">Go</a> - main Go website</li>
  <li><a href="http://tour.golang.org">Go Tutorial</a> - interactive
  tutorial</li>
  <li><a href="http://play.golang.org">Go Playground</a>
  - web-based form for submitting, executing, and sharing Go programs</li>
  <li><a href="https://gobyexample.com">Go by Example</a> - very similar in
  nature to this page</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2 id="details">About</h2>
<p>
These fragments were written using Go version 1 (1.0.3 to be exact).  Unless
noted otherwise, all fragments can be run by cutting and pasting into the
<a href="http://play.golang.org">playground</a>, or by saving the file locally
(e.g. to a file named example.go) and executing the following command in your
shell/terminal:
</p>

<pre>
$ go run example.go
</pre>

<p>
Note: This assumes you have already installed Go.
